Set up a Pair user
==================
run the install script or
1) make a new user
2) put pair_shell into the new users path probably /bin
3) add pash to /etc/shells
4) make pash the new users shell

now when ever a user loggs into pair@yourhost they will get dialog to connect to your pair session

this requires wemux to work
